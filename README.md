# GraphormerModelModification

The Graphormer Model is very constrained for handling maximum number of nodes with the UNREACHABLE_NODE_DISTANCE and struggles with memory issues. 

The approach of utilizing Large Language Models like LLaMA, ChemBERTa, and GPT that are both chemical and general-purpose transformers to improve RMSE, R Squared, AUROC, and F1 Scores was implemented in this project.
